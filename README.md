# GSoC2018: `rTrawl`


`rTrawl` provides an R package of functions for simulating and estimating both univariate and multivariate trawl processes. The package aims to aid practitioners and researchers in using the latest research for analysis of non-equally spaced time series using trawl processes.

In this project, I wrote the `rTrawl` package using base R and `RcppArmadillo` to have the best possible performance. The package contains state-of-the art estimation procedures and is capable of efficiently computing autocorrelation and cross-correlations for non-equidistant time series.
